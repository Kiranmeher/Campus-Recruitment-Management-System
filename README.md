# Campus-Recruitment-Management-System

The Campus Recruitment Management System (CRMS) is a web-based application designed to automate and streamline the campus placement process for educational institutions. It bridges the communication gap between students, college placement officers, and recruiters by providing a centralized platform to manage job postings, student applications, and placement activities.

This system allows students to register, create their profiles, upload resumes, and apply for job openings posted by recruiters. Recruiters can register, post job vacancies, view student applications, and shortlist candidates. Placement officers or administrators oversee the entire process, manage users, verify postings, and generate reports.
